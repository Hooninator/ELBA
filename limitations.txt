1. FASTA file is assumed to be correct.
2. FIXED - Sequences are assumed not to spill over multiple lines
3. Kmer universe size is assumed to be representable by int, i.e. <= 2,147,483,647
   This comes from the fact that MPI communications use int as size. To fix this we have
   to introduce chunking to comm calls.
